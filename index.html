                        I am originally from Washington. I lived in a small town in the eastern half of the state until
                        I was 18. Then I went to Eastern Washington University where I got my BA in Criminal Justice.

                        I then moved to Seattle and worked for a time in the mental health field providing in-home
                        support to people with developmental disabilities. However, I got tired of that kind of work an
                        decided to go to Chile and teach English for a year.

                        When I came back from Chile I went to Seattle University for my MA in Crime Analysis. After that
                        I got a job in working for the Fargo PD. I worked there for two years before I couldn't take it
                        anymore and I took a job at Lakewood PD. I worked for them for four years until I decided to
                        take a job with Denver PD in June of 2019.
